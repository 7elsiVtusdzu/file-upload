# How to Fix the Bouncing NPC Bug in Far Cry 2
 
Far Cry 2 is a classic open-world shooter that still has many fans today. However, some players may encounter a frustrating bug that causes non-player characters (NPCs) to bounce around and disrupt the game's story missions. This bug is related to running the game at high framerates, which can mess up the game's physics engine. Fortunately, there are some ways to fix this bug and enjoy the game without any bouncing NPCs.
 
## What Causes the Bouncing NPC Bug?
 
The bouncing NPC bug is caused by running Far Cry 2 at framerates higher than 60 frames per second (FPS). The game's physics engine was designed for 60 FPS, and anything higher can cause some NPCs to bounce around and glitch out. This can prevent them from triggering certain events or dialogues that are necessary for the story progression. For example, some players have reported that they could not start a mission with a bouncing NPC, or that they could not talk to an NPC who was stuck in a loop.

## How to Fix the Bouncing NPC Bug?
 
There are several methods to fix the bouncing NPC bug in Far Cry 2. The simplest one is to limit your framerate to 60 FPS using the in-game console or a third-party software. Another option is to turn on Vsync, which synchronizes your framerate with your monitor's refresh rate. However, some players may experience input lag or stuttering with Vsync on. A third option is to lower your graphics settings or switch to DirectX 9 mode, which may reduce your framerate naturally. Finally, you can also try using a mod that fixes the bug without requiring you to lock your framerate.
 
### Using the In-Game Console
 
The in-game console is a tool that allows you to enter commands and tweak various aspects of the game. To access it, you need to press the tilde key (~) on your keyboard. Then, you can type in the following command:
 `gfx_maxfps 60` 
This will limit your framerate to 60 FPS and prevent the bouncing NPC bug. However, you will need to enter this command every time you launch the game, unless you set it as a launch option in Steam.
 
### Using a Third-Party Software
 
If you don't want to use the in-game console, you can also use a third-party software that can limit your framerate for any game. One example is RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS), which is part of MSI Afterburner. You can download it from here: [https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html). After installing it, you can launch it and add Far Cry 2 to its list of applications. Then, you can set the Framerate limit option to 60 and apply the changes. This will limit your framerate to 60 FPS for Far Cry 2 only.
 
### Turning on Vsync
 
Vsync is a feature that synchronizes your framerate with your monitor's refresh rate, which can prevent screen tearing and other graphical issues. However, it can also introduce input lag or stuttering for some players. To turn on Vsync for Far Cry 2, you need to go to the game's options menu and select Display Settings. Then, you need to set Vertical Sync to On and save your settings. This will lock your framerate to your monitor's refresh rate, which is usually 60 Hz.
 
### Lowering Graphics Settings or Switching to DirectX 9 Mode
 
Another way to fix the bouncing NPC bug is to lower your graphics settings or switch to DirectX 9 mode, which may reduce your framerate naturally. To do this, you need to go to the game's options menu and select Display Settings. Then, you can adjust various settings such as Resolution, Anti-Aliasing, Shadows, etc. Alternatively, you can also switch from DirectX 10 mode to DirectX 9 mode by selecting it from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen. This may improve your performance
