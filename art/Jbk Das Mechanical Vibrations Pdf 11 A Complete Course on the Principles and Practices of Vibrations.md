## Chapter 1: Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations
 
In this chapter, you will learn the basic definitions and concepts of mechanical vibrations. You will also learn about the types and sources of vibrations, the effects of vibrations on human beings and machines, and the methods of vibration measurement and control.
 
Some of the key terms and concepts introduced in this chapter are:
 
- Vibration: a periodic or oscillatory motion of a system or a body about an equilibrium position.
- Free vibration: a vibration that occurs when a system is disturbed and then left to vibrate on its own.
- Forced vibration: a vibration that occurs when a system is subjected to an external force that varies with time.
- Natural frequency: the frequency at which a system vibrates when it is disturbed and then left to vibrate freely.
- Resonance: a condition in which the frequency of an external force matches the natural frequency of a system, resulting in large amplitude vibrations.
- Damping: a phenomenon that causes the amplitude of vibrations to decrease over time due to energy dissipation.
- Harmonic motion: a type of periodic motion in which the displacement of a system or a body varies sinusoidally with time.

To illustrate these concepts, let us consider a simple example of a mass-spring-damper system, as shown in Figure 1.1. This system consists of a mass m attached to a spring with stiffness k and a damper with damping coefficient c. The system is subjected to an external force F(t) that varies with time.

The equation of motion for this system can be derived using Newton's second law of motion, which states that the sum of the forces acting on a body is equal to its mass times its acceleration. The forces acting on the mass are the spring force, the damping force, and the external force. The spring force is proportional to the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position, and acts in the opposite direction. The damping force is proportional to the velocity of the mass, and also acts in the opposite direction. The external force is given by F(t). Therefore, we can write:
 $$m\ddotx + c\dotx + kx = F(t)$$ 
where x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position, $\dotx$ is its velocity, and $\ddotx$ is its acceleration.
 
This equation is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. It can be solved using various methods, such as characteristic equation method, Laplace transform method, or complex algebra method. The solution will depend on the initial conditions (the displacement and velocity of the mass at time t = 0) and the form of the external force F(t).
 
If F(t) = 0, then we have a free vibration problem. The solution will be a harmonic motion with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the system, given by:
 $$\omega\_n = \sqrt\frackm$$ 
The amplitude and phase of the harmonic motion will depend on the initial conditions. The natural frequency $\omega\_n$ is independent of the damping coefficient c. However, damping will affect the amplitude of the vibration over time. If c = 0, then we have an undamped system, and the amplitude will remain constant. If c > 0, then we have a damped system, and the amplitude will decay exponentially over time. The rate of decay will depend on the ratio of c to $\omega\_n$. If c < 2m$\omega\_n$, then we have an underdamped system, and the solution will be a damped harmonic motion with a frequency slightly lower than $\omega\_n$. If c = 2m$\omega\_n$, then we have a critically damped system, and the solution will be an exponential decay without any oscillation. If c > 2
