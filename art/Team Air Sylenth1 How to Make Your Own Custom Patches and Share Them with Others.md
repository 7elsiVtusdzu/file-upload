# Team Air Sylenth1: A Virtual Analog Synth for Superior Quality Sound
 
If you are looking for a software synthesizer that can rival the sound quality of hardware synths, you might want to check out Team Air Sylenth1. This is a virtual analog VSTi synthesizer that takes the definitions of quality and performance to a higher level. It was built from a producer's point of view, with the aim of producing superior quality sound and music. It has a graphical interface that ensures the highest level of usability, so you can fully unleash your creativity.
 
Team Air Sylenth1 is based on the original Sylenth1 by LennarDigital[^1^], but with some added features and improvements. It has 4 alias-free unison oscillators, which generate analog shaped waveforms. Each oscillator can produce 8 unison voices in full stereo, adding up to a total of 32 voices per note. With its 16 notes of polyphony, this means you can play up to 512 voices simultaneously! The oscillators perform extremely well in both the very low and very high frequency regions, without losing their sharpness, liveliness or character.

Team Air Sylenth1 also has 2 state of the art, pure analog sounding filter sections. Each of these consists of 4 filter stages with nonlinear saturation incorporated, in order to emulate the warmth and drive of a real analog filter. The resonance control can be turned up to a level way beyond self-oscillation, and combined with the drive control, this makes it possible to let the filters scream! Where a lot of digital filters sound like they're made out of cheap plastic, these filters sound rock-solid, warm and raw.
 
Team Air Sylenth1 offers many modulation options to sculpture the sound any way you like. There are 2 ADSR envelopes and 2 LFO's which can be used to modulate a whole set of different parameters. Next to that, it is possible to use the extra 2 amplitude envelopes, velocity, keyboard track or modulation wheel as a source for modulation. Team Air Sylenth1 also has a master effects section, with 7 professional quality sound effects and an arpeggiator, conveniently grouped into an LCD panel structure.
