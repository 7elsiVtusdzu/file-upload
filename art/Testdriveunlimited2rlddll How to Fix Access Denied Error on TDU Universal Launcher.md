Test Drive Unlimited 2 is an open world racing video game developed by Eden Games and published by Atari for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows[^2^]. Some players have reported an error message when trying to launch the game with the Universal Launcher, saying that rld.dll fails to load[^1^]. This file is part of a crack version of the game that is not supported by the Universal Launcher. Here are some possible solutions to fix this error:
 
- Make sure you have a legit copy of the game and not a cracked one. You can buy the game from Steam or other online platforms.

- Download and install the latest patch for the game from the official website or from here: [https://oldgamesdownload.com/test-drive-unlimited/](https://oldgamesdownload.com/test-drive-unlimited/)
- Run the game as administrator and in compatibility mode for Windows XP or Windows 7.

Test Drive Unlimited 2 is a sequel to the original Test Drive Unlimited, which was released in 2006. The game features over 100 licensed cars and motorcycles from various manufacturers, such as Aston Martin, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Pagani, and Ducati. The game also allows players to customize their vehicles and characters, as well as buy houses and furniture. The game has two main locations: Ibiza and Oahu. Ibiza is a new location for the series, while Oahu is a remastered version of the Hawaiian island from the first game. The game has a dynamic day-night cycle and weather system, as well as online multiplayer modes and social features.
 
The Universal Launcher is a third-party tool that allows players to launch the game with various options and mods. For example, players can use the Universal Launcher to play the game in windowed mode, change the resolution, enable or disable anti-aliasing, and use custom car skins. The Universal Launcher also supports some community-made mods that add new cars, tracks, and features to the game. However, the Universal Launcher is not compatible with some versions of the game, especially the cracked ones. This may cause some errors or crashes when trying to launch the game.
 
One of the most common errors that players encounter when using the Universal Launcher is the rld.dll error. This error occurs when the game cannot find or load the rld.dll file, which is part of a crack version of the game. The crack version is used to bypass the game's activation and online verification process. However, this also prevents the game from working properly with the Universal Launcher and other official updates. The rld.dll error may also indicate that the file is corrupted or infected by a virus.
