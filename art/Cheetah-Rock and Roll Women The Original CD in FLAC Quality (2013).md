Cheetah was an Australian hard rock band that was active from 1976 to 1984. The band consisted of sisters Chrissie and Lyndsay Hammond on vocals, Les Karski on guitar, Ian Miller on bass, and Ray Arnott on drums. Cheetah released their only album, Rock & Roll Women, in April 1982. The album featured 10 tracks of catchy and energetic rock music, influenced by AC/DC, The Rolling Stones, and The Runaways. Some of the highlights of the album include "Bang Bang", "Spend the Night", "Rock & Roll Women", and "Love You to the Limit". The album also contained a cover of The Ronettes' classic "Walking in the Rain", which was Cheetah's biggest hit, reaching No. 10 on the Australian charts in 1978.

Rock & Roll Women was produced by Vanda & Young, the legendary duo behind AC/DC and The Easybeats. The album received positive reviews from critics and fans, who praised Cheetah's vocal harmonies, guitar riffs, and catchy hooks. However, the album did not achieve much commercial success outside of Australia, and Cheetah disbanded in 1984. Rock & Roll Women remains a cult classic among hard rock fans, and a testament to Cheetah's talent and charisma.
 
In 2013, Rock & Roll Women was reissued on CD and FLAC formats by WRE Records, with improved sound quality and bonus tracks. The reissue was a welcome treat for Cheetah's loyal fans, who had been waiting for a long time to hear their favorite songs again. Rock & Roll Women is a must-have for any fan of hard rock, female rockers, or Australian music.

After Cheetah disbanded, the Hammond sisters pursued solo careers and worked as session singers for various artists. Chrissie Hammond sang backing vocals for John Farnham, Jimmy Barnes, and Richard Clapton, among others. She also released a solo album, The Edge of Love, in 1990. Lyndsay Hammond sang backing vocals for Olivia Newton-John, Air Supply, and Icehouse, among others. She also released a solo album, The Raven's Eye, in 1997. Les Karski continued to play guitar for various bands, such as The Nervous Investors, The Bondi Cigars, and The Hippos. He also produced albums for artists like The Foreday Riders, The Mighty Reapers, and The Detonators. Ian Miller and Ray Arnott also played with various bands and artists over the years.
 
Cheetah reunited for a one-off performance at the Countdown Spectacular 2 concert in Sydney in 2007. They played their hit "Walking in the Rain" and received a warm reception from the audience. The band members expressed their gratitude and joy for being able to play together again after so long. Cheetah remains one of the most underrated and influential hard rock bands in Australian music history. Their album Rock & Roll Women is a gem that deserves more recognition and appreciation from rock fans around the world.
