# Windows Server 2019 Features: What's New and Why You Should Upgrade
 
Windows Server 2019 is the latest version of Microsoft's server operating system that brings numerous innovations on four key themes: Hybrid Cloud, Security, Application Platform, and Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI). In this article, we will explore some of the new and improved features of Windows Server 2019 and how they can benefit your organization.
 
## Hybrid Cloud
 
Windows Server 2019 enables you to integrate your on-premises servers with cloud services such as Azure, Office 365, and Microsoft 365. Some of the hybrid cloud features include:

- **Windows Admin Center:** This is a browser-based app for managing servers, clusters, hyper-converged infrastructure, and Windows 10 PCs. It allows you to connect to Azure services such as Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Monitor, Azure Security Center, and Azure File Sync. You can also use Windows Admin Center to deploy and manage Windows Server containers and Kubernetes clusters on Azure or on-premises.
- **Storage Migration Service:** This is a new feature that helps you migrate your file servers and their data from older versions of Windows Server to Windows Server 2019 or Azure without downtime or data loss. It also helps you modernize your storage infrastructure by moving to newer hardware or cloud-based storage.
- **Azure Network Adapter:** This is a new feature that allows you to create a point-to-site VPN connection from your Windows Server 2019 machine to an Azure virtual network with just a few clicks. This simplifies the process of connecting your on-premises servers to Azure resources securely.

## Security
 
Windows Server 2019 enhances the security of your servers and applications with features such as:

- **Shielded Virtual Machines:** This feature, which was introduced in Windows Server 2016, allows you to protect your virtual machines from unauthorized access or tampering by encrypting them and restricting their operations. In Windows Server 2019, you can now shield Linux virtual machines as well as Windows ones. You can also run shielded virtual machines on hosts that are part of a failover cluster.
- **Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP):** This is a cloud-based service that helps you detect and respond to advanced attacks on your servers. It collects and analyzes behavioral data from your servers and provides alerts and recommendations for remediation. You can also use Windows Defender ATP to investigate incidents and hunt for threats across your network.
- **Windows Defender Exploit Guard:** This is a set of host-based intrusion prevention features that help you protect your servers from malware and other exploits. It includes four components: Attack Surface Reduction (ASR), Network Protection, Controlled Folder Access, and Exploit Protection.

## Application Platform
 
Windows Server 2019 improves the application platform for developers and IT pros with features such as:
